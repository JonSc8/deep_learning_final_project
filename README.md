Project: Implement the Traveling Salesperson Problem using the MuZero Framework 

Abstract:

The MuZero algorithm which combines a treebased search (MCTS) with a learned neural model
has proved to yield superhuman results in a variety of domains such as Chess, Go, Atari. Moreover, the MuZero algorithm does not require prior
knowledge of domain dynamics, game rules, or
pre-determined strategy. The course exercise,
which implements AlphaX over an NP-Complete
problem can therefore be enhanced by applying
the MuZero methodology. With Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) as an evaluation domain
at a manageable scale, we seek to demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance with MuZero.
