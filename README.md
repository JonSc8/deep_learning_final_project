Project: Implement the Traveling Salesperson Problem using the MuZero Framework 

Abstract:

The MuZero algorithm which combines a tree-based search (MCTS) with a learned neural model
has proved to yield superhuman results in a variety of domains such as Chess, Go, Atari. In addition, a fundamental feature of the MuZero algorithm is that it does not require prior
knowledge of domain dynamics, game rules, or
pre-determined strategy. The course exercise,
which implements AlphaX over an NP-Complete
problem can therefore be enhanced by applying
the MuZero methodology. With Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) as an evaluation domain
at a manageable scale, we seek to demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance with MuZero. 

The following report will  demonstrate the progress and current outcomes of the TSP MuZero implementation (to be referred as MuZeroTSP). As such, the report will analyze the ongoing progress rooted at the initial exercise (AlphaTSP) and will then examine the methodology, resources, and approaches used to transition from the AlphaZero framework to the MuZero framework. Specifically, we will demonstrate our attempts to formulate and resolve a novel approach to a MuZero-based TSP solution: training the model on a TSP environment without providing explicit knowledge of coordinates and essential spatial information.
